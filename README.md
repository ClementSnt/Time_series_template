** Daily Volume Forecasting – Time Series Templates library ** 

This repository will contain a set of reusable time series forecasting templates for daily volume prediction over long-term horizons.

Optional hybrid extension using boosting models on residuals might be added next.

The objective is to maintain a practical forecasting library that can be adapted to different business use cases (attendance, demand, traffic, revenue).

Additional time series models will be added progressively to expand this template collection.
